The SomaRouter plugin is using the library Davis.js, more information there:

To run this demo on your local server, edit the index.html to change the base href to match your path:

<base href="/myserverpath/router-relative/" />

You will get urls like:

http://localhost/myserverpath/router-relative/
http://localhost/myserverpath/router-relative/home
http://localhost/myserverpath/router-relative/about
http://localhost/myserverpath/router-relative/services
http://localhost/myserverpath/router-relative/contact
http://localhost/myserverpath/router-relative/articles
http://localhost/myserverpath/router-relative/articles/article1
http://localhost/myserverpath/router-relative/articles/article2
